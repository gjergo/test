  "bio": "<p>my art name is zebra and I'm a visual artist, illustrator and printer. i based my research on monochromatic configuration experimenting with xilography and etching and later i discovered silkscreen that allowed me to experimenting more with colors into visual art as a concept rather than as representation. I create instinctive drawings with colored pens, then I rework them, decompose them, and recombine them, printing them through screen printing.</p>",
